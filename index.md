# My Compendium
Welcome to my compendium! I like to learn things and think it is valuable to document it all. I do this because it helps with digesting the information while learning but also results in nice summaries afterwards.

Underneath is a list of my summaries separated by topic.

# Kotlin
The Kotlin programming language is full of features. Underneath all my notes on this language split up in multiple chapters.

2. [Object Oriented Programming](kotlin/bascis/oop.md)
3. [Usability Features](kotlin/basics/usability.md)
4. [Functional Programming](kotlin/basics/functional.md)
5. [Advanced Object Oriented Programming](kotlin/basics/aoop.md)
