# Kotlin Usability Features
This document contains a summary of multiple handy features Kotlin offers to make writing code easier.

## Extension functions
Extension functions are a technique to add new functions to a class outside of the class definition. This is especially handy when there is no access to the original class, for example when using a class through a package.
```kotlin
fun String.addHi() {
	return "Hi $this" //use this to access the class that is extended
}
```

## Named & Default Arguments
It is possible to give arguments to a function by their name. This can improve readability and it allows to give the arguments in a different order than specified. Function parameters can also contain default values. If no argument is given for a parameter with a default value, the default is used. 
```kotlin
fun addNumbers(one: Int = 0, two: Int = 0, three: Int = 0) {
	return one + two + three
}
addNumbers(
	one = 1,
	two = 5,
	three = 20
)
```

## Overloading
It is possible to create two functions with the same name as long as they have the same return type. Kotlin will figure out which one to call based on the given arguments.
```kotlin
fun makeStatement(text: String) = println(text)
fun makeStatement(number: Int) = println(number.toString())
makeStatement("HI")
makeStatement(15)
```
